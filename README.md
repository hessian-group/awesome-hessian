# awesome-hessian
Hessian is a serialization component , the official website is : http://hessian.caucho.com/

# Some suggestions
* **1，** It seems that the codes hosted in several websites (sourceforge and googlecode) , and the version of code is too old .  We can host the codes here and maintain continuously
* **2，** Collect all repos about hessian and find the best code of every language
* **3，** Some code has been found to have multiple versions, maintained independently, somewhat fragmented, considered merging, and developed together.
* **4，** Establish a community of Hessian to unite all the developers and users of hessian. Including the original author, each language client author
